# vue-virtual-stream ([Demo](https://zip-software.github.io/vue-virtual-stream/))

> A virtualized list component for chats, comment lists and streams in general.

[Demo](https://zip-software.github.io/vue-virtual-stream/)

This Vue component can be used to build large lists of virtual components without a limited amount of items (For example chats, comment sections, streams, etc.). It's not optimized for fetched data yet but will be optimized in the future.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**<br />
This package is not final yet and still in development. There can be strange behaviour while scrolling or recalculation of heights. Please create issues whenever you encounter a problem.

This repository contains

1. The source files for the Vue component
2. Scripts to built your own packaged versions via rollup
3. An example demo

## Background

Since Vue lacks a lot of virtualization options and the few we have are not optimized for unlimited sets of data, this package was started to be developed to counter some issues we have with large datasets in Vue at the moment. This includes

* Limitations of items in a list because of max-height limitation of DOM elements
* Unflexible behaviour when new items or content is pushed to the list
* Strange control on how the component should scroll or behave

## Install

You can install this package via NPM or Yarn.

```sh
npm i @zip-software/vue-virtual-stream --save
```

We also offer **esm**, **unpkg** and **umd** versions. You can find all different version in the `dist/` folder after the package finished building.

## Usage

```vue
<template>
    <virtual-stream :items="items">
        <template slot-scope="{ item, index }">
            <div>{{ item.text }}</div>
        </template>
    </virtual-stream>
</template>

<script>
    import VirtualStream from '@zip-software/vue-virtual-stream'

    export default {
        components: {
            VirtualStream,
        },
        ...
    }
</script>
```

## Options

### items
`items` needs to be an array of items to iterate through. You can use the `<template>` tag to customize rendering of items from outside of the component.

* **Types**: Array
* **Required**: true
* **Default**: none

```vue
<VirtualStream :items="items">
    <template slot-scope="{ item, index }">
        <div>{{ item.text }}</div>
    </template>
</VirtualStream>
```

### reversed
This prop can be used to enable scrolling from the bottom of the list. This will reverse scroll ordering and rendering.

* **Types**: Boolean
* **Required**: false
* **Default**: false

```vue
<VirtualStream :items="items" reversed>
    ...
</VirtualStream>
```

### itemsPerChunk
This prop controls how many items will be rendered per chunk. One chunk is a set of items which handles rendering of the list. They are used to preload new content or remove old unused content.

* **Types**: Number
* **Required**: false
* **Default**: 50

```vue
<VirtualStream :items="items" :itemsPerChunk="8">
    ...
</VirtualStream>
```

### preloadOffset
This prop controls how far you have to scroll in either the previous chunk or the next chunk to trigger a chunk skip to the next chunk. This is calculated in percent.

* **Types**: Number
* **Required**: false
* **Default**: 50
